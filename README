# Intro

Muchsync is a mail synchronizer for notmuch.  The project homepage is
[www.muchsync.org](http://www.muchsync.org/).

# To get latest the muchsync software, run:

    git clone http://www.muchsync.org/muchsync.git

# To build it after a git checkout, run the following:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

[Note:  you need pandoc to build the man page, otherwise `autogen.sh`
will fetch it from the web.]

# Using

Muchsync assumes that it's on your path on the server, but you can
specify the path on the command line with -r.  If you are tracking a
development version, you can put a symlink to the executable in your
home directory on all machines, and then run:

    ~/muchsync -r ./muchsync server

Of course, initial clones are kind of slow, so you probably want to
see what's happening.  You can add -vv before server to see what is
happening locally, and -vv after to see what is happening on the
server.  For example:

    ~/muchsync -r ./muchsync -vv server -vv

# Getting started

On the server, initialize the repository by running:

    muchsync -vv

On the client, to create a new replica from scratch, run one of:

    muchsync --init=/path/to/new/inbox -vv server -vv

    muchsync -r ./muchsync --init=/path/to/new/inbox -vv server -vv
